# Multi-source-data-integration
This project demonstrates data integration in Power BI by combining two different data sources â€” an Excel file with student attendance records and a CSV file with subject-wise grades. The merged dataset is used to create an interactive dashboard showcasing performance trends, pass/fail rates, attendance vs performance correlation.
